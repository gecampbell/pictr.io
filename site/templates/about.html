<p class="lead">Pictr is anonymous, ephemeral picture sharing.</p>

<p>Every picture uploaded has an expiration time; you can choose the value,
ranging from one minute to three hours. At the end of that time, the
picture expires and disappears from the Internet.</p>

<p>There are no tracking cookies, no logins, and nothing to connect you
with the picture. There are controls, however; if people don't like your
picture, it can be deleted more rapidly than the expiration time.</p>

<p>Specifically, clicking the <em>Hate</em> button on a pictures cuts
the expiration time remaining in half. Clicking <em>Love</em>,
however, increases the expiration time. If people really, really love
your picture, it will stay on the site longer!</p>

<p>Pictr is still a work in progress. I hope you enjoy it, and feel free
to share it with your friends. If you'd like to contribute, click on
the Github link at the bottom of the page and fork the repo&mdash;pull
requests are accepted, and the source code is released under the
Apache 2.0 license. If you find problems or would like to leave
feedback, please file a Github issue.</p>

<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Will my picture really disappear forever?</h3>
<p>Yes! Of course, there are always caveats, right? The pictures are stored
in <a href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> Cloud Files and have an
associated <code>Delete-At</code> value. Thus, at the appointed time
(within an error range of a few seconds), the stored object will be
deleted.</p>
<p>The images are stored in a
<abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> to improve performance; it's
possible that the images will still be available through the CDN for another few minutes after the source has been deleted because they are cached.</p>
<p>If someone has downloaded the picture, or if it's stored in a
cache somewhere, then my site cannot control those other versions.</p>

<h3>Is it really anonymous?</h3>
<p>None of your personally-identifiable information is stored <em>as part
of this system</em>. I use Google Analytics to measure traffic, and it does
something (probably a cookie) to determine unique individuals, but I have
no way of telling who you are from that.</p>
<p>Likewise, all web systems have some
level of logging where your IP address and other technical data is logged,
mainly so that we have some way of finding and correcting problems.</p>
<p>But please note that you don't have to login to use the system, and it's not
linked to any of your social media accounts. You can share pictures via
<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (and possibly other services),
but that's under your control.</p>
